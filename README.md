# Static Site Generator

This is a static site generator. It's objective is to **convert** markdown (.md) files to **HTML pages** which can be serviced on the web easier, using a template stylesheet and HTML page.

## Getting started

1. **Clone** this repository `git clone https://github.com/Leowondeh/static-site-generator.git` or download it as a zip archive.

2. Enter the root folder and run the script `main.sh` to generate the necessary folders.

3. Move your **image** and **stylesheet** (.css) files into the `static` folder and your **markdown** (.md) files into the `content` folder.

4. Re-run the generator. Your **generated site** should be in the `public` folder, and an **HTTP server** will also start running for your convenience [locally](localhost:8888). To stop the server, use **CTRL-C**.
